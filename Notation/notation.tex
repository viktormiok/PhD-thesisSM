\begin{notation}

In order to distinguish between one-dimensional and multidimensional objects we use
boldface symbols. Scalars are not boldfaced while vectors and matrices are. To differentiate
between vectors and matrices we use italic symbols. A vector is denoted by an
italic boldface symbol whereas a matrix is denoted by an upright boldface one. Here
follows a more detailed list of math fonts and conventions used in this thesis.
\\
\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Scalar variables are denoted by lower case italics or Greek symbols (e.g. $t$, $\lambda$).
\item Functionals and scalar functions are denoted by lower- or upper case italics or
lower case Greek symbols (e.g. $\delta_x$, $l$, $L$, $\psi$).
\item Vectors are denoted by bold italics or bold Greek (e.g. $\mathbf{y}$, $\mathbf{Y}$, $\boldsymbol{\mu}$).
\item Vector functions are denoted by bold italics or bold Greek (e.g. $\mathbf{f}$).
\item Matrices are denoted by bold upper case Roman or bold upper case Greek (e.g. $\mathbf{A}$, $\boldsymbol{\Theta}$).
\item Matrix functions are denoted by bold upper- or lower case Roman (e.g. $\mathbf{F}$, $\mathbf{g}$).
\item Operators are denoted by upper case Roman (e.g. P, G).
\item The derivative is upright sans serif D, differential is lower case Roman d and the
symbol $\partial$ is used for partial differential.
\item Sub/superscripts that are variables are in italics or Greek, while those that are
labels are Roman (e.g. $\mathbf{y}_k$, $l_{\lambda}$, $BIC_{KLCV}$).
\item Brackets are arranged in the order $|\{()\}|$
