%Lord receive my deepest gratitude for successful completion of a PhD thesis, for directing my paths and for all your help during this journey. On this intense and at times very enjoyable journey, many people have helped me. The time has come for me to thank all them for all the support I received.
				
%First and foremost, my deepest gratitude goes to Wessel van Wieringen and Saskia Wilting for their insightful guidance, sincere criticism, patient support and all the efforts and time that they put in me. They offered everything that a student could ask for from his or her advisor. I cannot imagine how I could accomplish my dissertation without their guidance and help. They also left an enduring imprint on me with their way of approaching work and research, which I will benefit from for my entire career. Words alone cannot express the respect and gratitude my family and I do have for you.
					
%I would also like to express my gratitude towards my promoters Mark van de Wiel and Renske Steenbergen, as well as to Peter Snijders, for tremendous support, giving valuable suggestion that improved my dissertation.
				
%I wish to thank the members of the reading committee, including Hans Berkhof, Mathisca de Gunst, Jeanine Houwing-Duistermaat, Ed Schuuring, Wim Van Criekinge for spending their valuable time on careful reading of my thesis and giving me interesting feedback.
				
%I would like to thank past and present members of the Epidemiology $\&$ Biostatistics Department  and Pathology Department at the VUmc, that I have had the pleasure to work with. The group has been a source of friendship, good advice and collaboration. I thank particularly to Nimisha Chaturvedi and Gwenael Leday for all their explanations and help during tough times I had in the beginning of my PhD. I am grateful to the: Andrea Bassi, Gino Kpogbezan and Carel Peeters for their advices and support.
